## Problem
Farmers are always exploited by the middleman who tends to take goods from farmers at lesser rates than what he sells to the consumers. In this way, farmers do not get the complete value of their hard work.

## Solution
Krishi app helps the farmer to register their products online with many specified things such as price, photo, quantity available, Pin code, etc. By using the app, farmers can directly reach out to their customers without the involvement of middlemen. This would help them to get the best value for their product and improve their economic condition.
